                    <h2>Automata... Waaa?</h2>
                    <h3>To know why we have antivirus software we have to know about viruses.</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first published theory of a computer virus was in 1949 by Jhon von Neumann.
                        The theory was focused on self replicating computer programs. Neumann called them Automana.
                        This was prior to the internet. But, in 1971 the first self-replicating program, called Creeper
                        built by
                        Bob
                        Thomas, was release on ARPANET. ARPANET was one of the first internets. The program was built in
                        to
                        "infect"
                        specific computers running a specific operating system and had to be on ARPANET. Bob Thomas,
                        being
                        the
                        nice
                        guy that he was, also wrote the program to delete Creeper. It was, of course, called Reaper.
                        This
                        could
                        be
                        considered the first anti-virus, but technically it was a virus itself, written to delete
                        Creeper.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The First Virus</h2>
                    <h3>Poetic Virus</h3>

                    <p>
                        The first known was written by a 15 year-old kid. Rick Skrenta wrote the program Elk Cloner as a
                        joke in
                        1981.
                        The virus would infect Apple DOS 3.3 systems by copping itself to the computer. When another
                        floppy
                        disk,
                        remember those?!!, was inserted into the computer the virus would copy itself to the floppy. The
                        virus
                        was
                        not intended to harm or to make a profit. So what did it do you ask? Tell you a poem, of course.
                        On
                        the
                        50th
                        boot of the game it was attached to it would display a blank screen with a poem on it.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Elk Cloner:</h3>
                    <p>The program with a personality</p>
                    <p>It will get on all your disks</p>
                    <p>It will infiltrate your chips</p>
                    <p>Yes, it's Cloner!</p>
                    <p>It will stick to you like glue</p>
                    <p>It will modify RAM too</p>
                    <p>Send in the Cloner!</p>
                    <p>
                        The first virus "in the wild" was a called Brian. It was meant to track pirated software and
                        lock
                        the
                        computer. It is considered the first MS-DOS virus.

                    <h2>The First Antivirus</h2>
                    <h3>One Program</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first antivirus was written by Bernd Fix. He wrote a program that remove one specific virus,
                        Vienna
                        Virus, in 1987. 1987 was the year the floodgates open for antivirus software. Many companies and
                        software
                        created then are still around today. See the list to the right of early antivirus names.
