            <h2>Automata... Waaa?</h2>
            <h4>To know why we have antivirus software we have to know about viruses.</h4>
            <p>
                The first published theory of a computer virus was in 1949 by Jhon von Neumann.
                The theory was focused on self replicating computer programs. Neumann called them Automana.
                This was prior to the internet. But, in 1971 the first self-replicating program, called Creeper built by
                Bob
                Thomas, was release on ARPANET. ARPANET was one of the first internets. The program was built in to
                "infect"
                specific computers running a specific operating system and had to be on ARPANET. Bob Thomas, being the
                nice
                guy that he was, also wrote the program to delete Creeper. It was, of course, called Reaper. This could
                be
                considered the first anti-virus, but technically it was a virus itself, written to delete Creeper.

        <h2>The First Virus</h2>
        <h4>Poetic Virus</h4>

        <p>
            The first known was written by a 15 year-old kid. Rick Skrenta wrote the program Elk Cloner as a joke in
            1981.
            The virus would infect Apple DOS 3.3 systems by copping itself to the computer. When another floppy disk,
            remember those?!!, was inserted into the computer the virus would copy itself to the floppy. The virus was
            not intended to harm or to make a profit. So what did it do you ask? Tell you a poem, of course. On the 50th
            boot of the game it was attached to it would display a blank screen with a poem on it.
        </p>
        <div id="poem">
            <h4>Elk Cloner:</h4>
            <p>The program with a personality</p>
            <p>It will get on all your disks</p>
            <p>It will infiltrate your chips</p>
            <p>Yes, it's Cloner!</p>
            <p>It will stick to you like glue</p>
            <p>It will modify RAM too</p>
            <p>Send in the Cloner!</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The first virus "in the wild" was a called Brian. It was meant to track pirated software and lock the
            computer. It is considered the first MS-DOS virus.
        </p>

        <h2>The First Antivirus</h2>
        <h4>One Program</h4>
        <p>
            The first antivirus was written by Bernd Fix. He wrote a program that remove one specific virus, Vienna
            Virus, in 1987. 1987 was the year the floodgates open for antivirus software. Many companies and software
            created then are still around today. See the list to the right of early antivirus names.
